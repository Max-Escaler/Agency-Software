AGENCY is free software intended for use by non-profit
organizations, and may be useful to other people or
groups as well.

AGENCY is designed to be flexible and customizable.
There are currently two 'flavors' of AGENCY:

"client:"  Designed for social service agencies,
especially homeless service organizations;

"donor:"   Designed for fundraising purposes,
to track donations and volunteers.

For information about AGENCY goals and philosophy,
see README.goals.

AGENCY is a fork and continuation of CHASERS.
For more information about the history of AGENCY
and CHASERS, see README.history.

At this point, all the code in AGENCY is
copyright either by myself, or by Downtown
Emergency Service Center.  See README.copyright
for more information. 

More information (and probably more current information)
about AGENCY is available on the internet,
at agency-software.org.

For historical purposes, I've included the
original README for CHASERS in this distribution
of AGENCY.  See README.CHASERS.
