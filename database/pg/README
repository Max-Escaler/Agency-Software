This directory contains the files needed to create a AGENCY database.

AGENCY now supports multiple flavors (currently client or donor).
The files in the agency_core directory are installed first, and
are presumably common across flavors.

After the agency_core files are installed, then additional files
are installed for your chosen flavor.

See the README.install file for specific steps about how to install AGENCY.
